        <p>The human&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mind is vulnerable and negative, and one of the best remedies to prevent being prey to negative thoughts is a book. 
            Books are an irreplaceable asset to humanity. Some even say that books are man's best friend.
             No other human can do us as much good as a good book can.</p>
        <p>Yet, many optimistic activists and environmentalists believe that there is still scope for change and improvement, and we can save the Earth. 
            Governments must switch to sustainable development and production methods and cut down their pollution levels.</p>
        <p>One of print media's widely accessible forms of mass communication is the newspaper.
             Newspapers report daily happenings or news events occurring almost anywhere.</p>
        <p> Education is a quintessential part of our society, and it is the only way we can ensure the growth and development of our community. 
            It is a highly essential part of our life which we all should consider as our top priority and channelise most of our attention to. 
            It is the doorway to success and plays a significant role in our life.</p>
        <p> Water is the source of sustenance for the entire universe. The decline in drinking water and polluted water bodies can cause more damage than what we can afford. 
            The current situation concerning water scarcity is horrifying. Every year 22nd March is celebrated as World Water Day to mark the importance of drinking water.</p>
